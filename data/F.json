Signals are the raw materials used in many forms of electronic art and design - electronic music, interactive art, video art, kinetic sculpture, and more. In these fields, signals are used to represent information about sound, images, sensors, and movement. By transforming and manipulating these types of signals, we are able to create powerful new tools for digital art, multimedia applications, music, responsive environments, video and sound installation, smart products, and beyond.  In this course we will study Signal Processing from a practical point-of-view, developing tools that can be easily integrated into art-making using the graphical programming environment Max (a.k.a. Max/MSP/Jitter).  We will present a survey of Signal Processing techniques used in the sonic and visual arts, and will discuss the mathematical theories underlying these techniques.

For vehicle applications, they offer efficiency and environmental advantages compared with traditional combustion engines. In the first half of the course, the focus is on understanding the thermodynamics and electrochemistry of the various types of fuel cells, such as calculating the open circuit voltage and the sources of voltage loss due to irreversible processes for the main fuel cells types: PEM/SOFC/MCFC. The design and operation of several real fuel cells are then compared against this theoretical background.  The second half of the course focuses on the balance-of-plant requirements of fuel cell systems, such as heat exchangers, pumps, fuel processors, compressors, as well as focusing on capital cost estimating.

Prepare  means to develop a high-level understanding of the research-with-a-goal architecting process. Plan means to identify, propose, and schedule the intended course of a specific project. Execute means to obtain data, preferably with an industrial sponsor identified in the plan  segment, but potentially alternatively in a university research lab.  Analyze means to draw defensible conclusions from the data, and accordingly to plan a commercialization route.

The central subject of this course is process, not product. The programs that you will do are a means of teaching process, not an end product in themselves. The amount of process activity is clearly excessive for these simple problems. We suggest you read through all the programming problem specifications at the beginning so you will know where they are going early in the course. Then, when you feel that the process burden is too great, imagine doing a series of 300 line modules using the PSP, and see if you feel differently. We think that you will see the point very quickly and find yourself unconsciously applying parts of PSP to your own work before the course is done.  This course is intended for practicing software engineers and their managers. The measures introduced can serve as the basis for software development process improvement in the organization as well as helping individuals. Students who go on to take a more comprehensive course in the PSP will be able to concentrate more completely on advanced metrics and PSP is required if you intend to follow on with the concepts in the Team Software Process (TSP).  Requirement:  Since this is a development oriented class and involves writing code, all the normal tools one may use to develop code in their language of choice are required. You should NOT use this course as an opportunity to learn a new language as this course is intended to measure your already instantiated personal process.  Learning a new language will most likely cause you to change your personal process. Course requirements are not solely grounded in theory.

We tend to think of totalitarian regimes where the State controls information and prohibits the expression of dissenting views. We also tend to associate propaganda with certain rhetorical techniques - highly emotional words, deceptive representations, and glittering generalities that inhibit rational thought and manipulate public opinion. According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies. Finally, we will consider how to analyze propaganda, generating methodological prerequisites for scholarly study.

Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains.  The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the clouds motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies.

This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a sweet spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society?

Internationalization processes and globalization are general phenomena, increasingly booming in the last decades as rarely before. The arts sector (however defined) is not an exception: in terms of both demand and supply, no matter the specific arts discipline, there are clear tendencies towards the creation of a ?global? market. Here however ? more than in other contexts ? important local characteristics tend to ?resist? the process of homologation within a single global (undifferentiated) ?market?. Identity processes are often involved; different administrative trajectories also play a central role, in particular related to radical different roles played by the State and different government levels.  The course is organized around three main ideas. First, understanding the rhetorical nature of management (in general and in the particular case of art management) is an indispensable prerequisite to understand the social construction base of management discourse, and it possible variations. Second, there is the need to take seriously into account the implications emerging from organizational theory and strategic change literature in the context of the art sector, from bounded rationality to the dynamics of change. Third, there is a need to learn to deal with public sector changes in the variety of administrative context across different countries and different administrative traditions.

We will start by discussing the clouds motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models.  Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources.

Participate by asking questions, contributing to the discussion, and giving constructive verbal and written feedback to presenters. Using an electronic device for purposes other than note-taking or feedback on the presentation is considered to be non-participation.  C.  Give 3 well-prepared SSSG talks per year (2 if giving an approved talk in an outside venue) The faculty recognizes that students may occasionally have conflicts with particular SSSG dates; in these cases the Reasonable Person Principle applies. There may occasionally be a systematic conflict, such as an overlapping course, in which case advance approval should be arranged with advisor and PhD Program Director (but not more than once for any student).

Public policy is the study of the written and unwritten principles on which law is based. Laws and regulations translate policy into action. Public policy and laws form the basis of health policy. Health policy is supported by: - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy.  Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process. Its promise is to promote better decision making by envisioning how micro decisions interconnect to mission, goals and outcomes.

Modernist art objects  were transportable, nomadic, could only exist in the museum space and were the objects of the market and co-modification. Since 1960s the artists were trying to find a way out of this situation, and thus drew attention to the site and the context around a specific site.  Installation Art is a pervasive, varied and global practice for art making that acts as a gathering place for expression in all media, addressing all subjects in a wide range of styles by broad grouping of artists. It collapses traditional media boundaries and discipline boundaries.    In this class we will address some of the historical, conceptual, and theoretical aspects of contemporary art while studying a broad range of Site-Specific Art and Installation work. Questions we will explore include, if this category of art making is so broad, how is it different  from other forms of visual art? How can we define it at all? During the course students will explore the history of installation art as a genre  of art making that encourages invention and new ways of thinking about presentation and communication of ideas.  Site and Installation Art is based on the merger of Space and Time and on a relationship between the artist, space and the visitor. It continues to change over time, from early Dada exhibitions to community-involved constructions as found in Relational and Community Contextual practices. New Technology has become a vital tool for artists working in this genre.  The idea that materials and concepts are brought together in a temporary construction is something that is typical of most of this art.

Instead, many companies have overly focused on inserting technology interfaces while under-serving the customer.  Or, they have focused on how they want to approach/manipulate the customer rather than on what the customer wants from the interaction.    This course explores the concepts of customer service and customer-driven within the context of service, e-commerce, and other companies.  It will examine what companies must do to attract, keep, and get repeat business from highly satisfied customers.  It will explore how traditional businesses accomplish these goals and whether traditional concepts/tools apply to e-commerce companies.  When possible, it will highlight traditional and e-commerce companies that provide positive and negative examples.    The course will also distinguish between e-commerce companies that provide a service and those that are customer-driven arms for manufacturing companies.

It is intended for women only because it is believed that the presence of males in class (other than instructors or other authorized persons) can alter the emotional and physical responses of women to class material and thereby hinder their ability to reach course objectives.  It is of the utmost importance that women be able to maximize their opportunity to learn in the company of like-minded students.  The core of the course is based upon the principles of the Rape Aggression Defense System (R.A.D.)which was conceived and developed by Larry N. Nadeau.  His goal in developing R.A.D. is also its motto:  To develop and enhance the options of self-defense, so they may become viable considerations to the woman who is attacked.  This course is composed of three sections:  risk reduction principles, physical defense techniques, and simulation.  Risk reduction principles include a thorough review of personal self-awareness  the environment, whether in the home, neighborhood, or unfamiliar community.  Physical defense techniques include the introduction to bodily strikes with hands, kicks with the feet, and defenses against grabs  holds.  Simulation is the activity that attempts to incorporate, via physical demonstration, all emotional  physical techniques that have been taught through the acting out of scenarios involving instructors (padded/protected) as attackers, and students (padded/protected) responding to the assault.", "units": 3.0, "sections": [], "department": "Physical Education", "name": "Rape Agression Defense Systems (RAD)"}, "90-907": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"times": [{"begin": "10:30AM", "room": "1208", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "11:50AM", "days": [2, 4], "building": "HBH"}, {"begin": "03:00PM", "room": "1208", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "04:20PM", "days": [5], "building": "HBH"}], "instructors": ["Baird, Matthew"], "name": "A"}], "desc": null, "units": 12.0, "sections": [], "department": "Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt", "name": "Econometric Theory and Methods"}, "42-744": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"times": [{"begin": "09:00AM", "room": "5421", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "10:20AM", "days": [1, 3], "building": "WEH"}], "instructors": ["Cheng, Boyle"], "name": "A"}], "desc": "This course is an introduction to the engineering, clinical, legal and regulatory aspects of medical device performance and failure.

Students will gain a perspective of various current theories and models of innovation, how innovations are brought to the market and positioned for successful launch and subsequent growth.  Students study and discuss both successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring innovations to the market via a series of lectures, readings, and case discussions.

It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social, economic, and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced.  It is strategic because of rapid changes in the marketplace and the competitive-set which the opportunity must confront for execution in the emerging marketplace (emergent strategy or agile approach).  Student teams are expected to take on a project determined by the team (with faculty approval) or framed by an outside organization (within or external to CMU).

The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.  The course is designed for LTI  SCS graduate students, but others are welcome.  CS UG upperclassmen whove taken it have done well, though they found it challenging.  The 11-661 version does not require the course project.  Prerequisites: Strong quantitative aptitude.  Comfort with basic UG-level probability.

According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies.

An important property of these models is that they can learn useful representations by re-using and combining intermediate concepts, allowing these models to be successfully applied in a wide variety of domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, natural language processing, and speech perception.

The course will also include additional advanced topics such as privacy in machine learning, interactive learning, reinforcement learning, online learning,  Bayesian nonparametrics, and additional material on graphical models.  Students entering the class are expected to have a pre-existing strong working knowledge of algorithms, linear algebra, probability, and statistics.

As time permits, select person variables will also be considered, e.g., the impact of depressive mood on health.  Class time will be largely taken by discussion of original research papers.  Different sets of students will be responsible for leading these discussions.  Grades will be based on a combination of class participation, quality of paper presentations, and performance on a final research paper.", "units": 9.0, "sections": [], "department": "Psychology", "name": "Personality and health"}, "93-861": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"times": [{"begin": null, "room": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": null, "days": null, "building": null}], "instructors": ["Green, Daniel"], "name": "A"}], "desc": "This course is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the creative process in both film and television as it relates to story and script analysis.

Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing. While many marketing activities are geared toward creating value for the customer, sound pricing decisions are the fundamental tool for businesses to capture the value they create. In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing. The course objectives are (1) to build the right pricing philosophy that guides everyday marketing activities, (2) to introduce a framework, based on concepts drawn from cognitive psychology, economics and industrial organization, to study pricing decisions, and (3) to master some concrete analytical and numerical tools for its successful creation, utilization, and management of sound pricing decisions", "units": 6.0, "sections": [], "department": "Tepper School of Business", "name": "Pricing Strategy"}, "73-402": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"times": [{"begin": null, "room": "DNM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": null, "days": null, "building": "DNM"}], "instructors": ["Instructor TBA"], "name": "A"}], "desc": "This number holds a place for upper level economics elective study abroad transfer credit courses so that these courses can be used in the academic audit system.", "units": null, "sections": [], "department": "Economics", "name": "Study Aboard Upper Level Economics Elective"}, "85-101": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"times": [{"begin": null, "room": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": null, "days": null, "building": null}], "instructors": ["Donahoe, Erin"], "name": "A"}], "desc": "Students who enroll in Introductory Psychology Courses (100 level or 200 level) are required to complete a research requirement.

Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis.

A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the programs merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making.  Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.  This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation.

The writings of famous Western esotericists, including Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Eliphas Levi, Aleister Crowley, Eugen Grosche, and Austin Osman Spare, will also be studied and discussed.", "units": 3.0, "sections": [], "department": "StuCo (Student Led Courses)", "name": "Student Taught Courses (StuCo): Introduction to Western Esotericism & Occultism"}, "03-115": {"coreqs": "03-110 or 03-121 or 03-151", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": false, "reqs_list": [["03-110", "03-121", "03-151"]]}, "lectures": [{"times": [{"begin": "01:30PM", "room": "2303", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "02:00PM", "days": [2, 4], "building": "DH"}], "instructors": ["Jarvik, Jonathan", "McGuier, Natalie"], "name": "Lec"}], "desc": "This course will provide an introduction to biological investigation through a research project in bacteriophage genomics. Genomics combines experimental and computational approaches for large-scale analysis of the biological information contained in DNA sequences. The ability to analyze the complete DNA of any organism has revolutionized modern genetics and is influencing many areas of biology and medicine. The most abundant biological entities are bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). Their enormous diversity and number make bacteriophages important models for the study of gene structure, function and regulation, population genetics and evolution. In addition they are the source of important tools in biotechnology. The research goals of this course will be to identify new bacteriophage species and incorporate them into a comparative genomic study to better understand the genetic organization and evolution of these organisms. While accomplishing these goals students will develop an understanding of the research process, including the ability to design experiments and interpret novel data.    Fall semester: Samples will be collected in the field. From these samples students will identify and purify bacteriophages. The bacteriophages will be characterized structurally by electron microscopy, and their DNA will be purified and sequenced.", "units": 6.0, "sections": [{"times": [{"begin": "01:30PM", "room": "2303", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "04:20PM", "days": [2, 4], "building": "DH"}], "instructors": ["McGuier, Natalie", "Jarvik, Jonathan"], "name": "A"}, {"times": [{"begin": "01:30PM", "room": "2196", "location": "Doha, Qatar", "end": "04:20PM", "days": [1, 3], "building": "CMB"}], "instructors": ["Vincent, Annette"], "name": "W"}], "department": "Biological Sciences", "name": "Phage Genomics Research"}, "27-519": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"times": [{"begin": "08:30AM", "room": "4102", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "10:20AM", "days": [1, 3], "building": "GHC"}], "instructors": ["Webler, Bryan"], "name": "A"}], "desc": "Computational thermodynamics is a powerful tool of a Materials Engineer.

Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen digitally on screen. While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photographic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W.

The linguist brings a wealth of experience to the problem, with a history of success in decoding languages currently spoken as well as written scripts from languages long forgotten. The interstellar communicator has as yet no evidence of success, facing the added challenge that any such communication is most likely one-way, and that the intended audience may not even exist. Still, both are dealing with arbitrary systems of signs the meaning of which cannot be inferred directly from form. The aim of this seminar, then, is to apply lessons from linguistics to the problem of devising systems for interstellar communication, while at the same time applying lessons learned from that exercise to issues in communication between humans using natural language. Students will examine past and recent attempts to design interstellar language and they will look at case studies in which difficult or dead languages have been decoded.

Considering theater as an ancient technology of mass participation and social cohesion, this fusion studio explores how emerging technologies can expand upon the basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways.  Collaboration and integration of design, media and storytelling is critical to this approach.  Experimentation with new forms can reanimate the basic values of theater; the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience. Expanded Theater is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional theatrical production modes and beyond each students individual discipline.

Summary: Planning is ubiquitous in everyday life -- from planning how to make dinner to planning how to graduate from University with the least amount of work. Researchers in AI have studied planning problems for many years, and many techniques exist for automating planning processes.  This course will explore both classical and modern approaches to planning. Issues to be discussed include: how to represent actions and world state, how to search for plans efficiently, how to deal with uncertainty in actions and the world state, how to find good or optimal plans,how to represent time, and how to dynamically combine planning and execution.  Specific planning techniques to be covered include: means-ends analysis, linear and non-linear planning, partial-order planning, graph-based planning, heuristic planning, BBD-based planning, hierarchical planning, temporal planning, conditional and conformant planning, probabilistic planning and learning using Markov models (MDPs and POMDPs), integration of planning, perception and execution, execution monitoring and replanning, path planning, multi-agent planning, and scheduling.

Each student will complete an original research project, some of which may be adapted for publication in a California news outlet. The course is designed particularly, though not exclusively, for students interning at news organizations, political press offices, speechwriting groups, public relations firms or those with a passion for writing or politics. The instructor is veteran journalist Marc Sandalow, former Washington Bureau Chief for the San Francisco Chronicle, political analyst, and the author of a biography on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

During the early part of the semester, students will learn basic programming using Python through examples and problem sets that are relevant to text analysis. Then, students will be introduced to a limited set of commonly used Python packages for text analysis, such as natural language processing, statistical analysis, visualization, web scraping, and social media text mining.   Students are expected to complete a small final project that examines how evidence-based data-driven insights derived from text analysis would support humanistic research in their area of interest, including (but not limited to) genre studies, rhetorical criticism, authorship attribution, discourse analysis, cultural analysis, social network analysis, spatial/temporal text analysis, and writing assessment.

One of many examples is the new technology of driverless cars; every major automotive company has them in their product pipeline. What opportunities does this represent to a new robotics entrepreneur?  We help to identify an opportunity for a robotics business and explore the business fundamentals of how to build and manage it.  The first step is to develop an appropriate innovative idea that can find a profitable home in the marketplace.  To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the prevalent trends of the current economic environment and how to market and position your product.  Here we utilize experts in marketing and innovation management.  The product may be a consumer product, or an improvement process  for some aspect of a business cycle (e.g., manufacturing or service).  However, we expect that the selected invention will be a new type of robot, a robotic application or part of an ever expanding robotic-ecosystem.  Please note that we have a very expansive view of what can count as a robot  Once a project area is selected we introduce the financial basics that are necessary to fund and sustain a new product initiative.  In the end, the product idea must be sold to either venture capitalists, private funding agents, corporate funding agents or government agencies.  The course is a project based and is executed by a team of you and your fellow students.

inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity.

Economic drivers have forced a need for greater efficiency and significant IT cost reduction. And for the past decade, significant investment made toward maturing traditional project management, SDLC processes, organizational alignment and capability all have had limited results in (and a limited focus on) effectively delivering value. Industry has passed its tipping point in adopting agile methods, and so companies are investing in talent to help make the pivot from traditional plan-driven approaches to that of value-driven results.  Learning Objectives: 1. Students will gain hands-on skills and experience applying Agile Principles, and engage in Scrum and Kanban practices - both are popular agile methodologies in high demand with todays employers  2. Students will be able to demonstrate critical thinking and applied problem solving against a complex holistic system of agile values, principles and practices, and challenges of scaling to the enterprise.  3.

Yet considerations about how we write - coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance - can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, Who is my audience? and What is my purpose?

They are data intensive rather than compute intensive as we see with mainstream super computers spending the bulk of their time performing data I/O and manipulation rather than computation.  They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well.  Given that they often operate in the commercial space the cost-performance of these systems needs to be such that the organizations dependent on such systems can turn a profit. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover the set of topics needed in order to design and build data intensive scalable systems.  In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance.   Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important.  These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns.  This course will introduce students to these concerns with the intent that they understand the extent to which things like deploying, monitoring, and upgrading impact the design. The course will be a hands-on project oriented course.  The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.
