New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive.

Materials do not stand alone in development however, they are a result of, or are influenced by, technological needs and developments. The more advanced the material, the more energy and effort is required for its production. In the US, the production of materials accounts for about 90 of the countrys energy usage. This fact clearly indicates a strong tie between materials and energy, and without energy, technological developments based on material advancement will not occur.    In our world today, the need to provide improved performance, economics and design in consumer goods comes as a direct result of the market conditions established by consumers. Material selection and design therefore is driven by application and consumer needs which implies that the consumer has a large influence on material consumption. Material selection and material usage in turn have major ecological  implications in energy, material resources and direct environmental impact.

Unfortunately, device scaling has hit a limit   on performance and power improvements dictated by physical device properties. To continue to make systems capable, fast, energy efficient, programmable, and reliable in this post-Dennard era, computer architects must be creative and innovate across the layers of the system stack.  This course begins with a recap of conventional, sequential computer architecture concepts.  We will then discuss the end of convention, brought about by the end of Dennard Scaling and Moores Law, and several trends that these changes precipitated.  The first trend is the wholesale shift to parallel computer architectures and systems, covering parallel hardware and software execution models, cache coherence, memory consistency, synchronization, transactional memory, and architecture support for programming, debugging, and failure avoidance.  The second trend is the shift to incorporating specialized, heterogeneous components into parallel computer architectures.

There may occasionally be a systematic conflict, such as an overlapping course, in which case advance approval should be arranged with advisor and PhD Program Director (but not more than once for any student). In the rare case when a students participation or presentations falls significantly below expectations, the faculty will require remedial action appropriate to the student.

The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

In the process, it covers basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. Module 2 covers computational cell biology, including biological modeling and image analysis. It includes homeworks requiring modification of scripts to perform computational analyses. The modeling component includes computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, neuron behavior, and stochastic simulations. The imaging component includes basics of machine vision, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models.

In the final weeks of the semester, we will address German cinema in the post-unification period, which has experienced a revival in popularity and interest.  The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood.  Among the great directors focused on in the course of the semester will be Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Fritz Lang, Leni Riefenstahl, Wolfgang Staudte, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.

What constitutes a treatment or an independent variable: lesson content, instructional method, teacher qualifications, student attributes,      educational ?philosophy?  ?approach? 3. What is the appropriate grain size of the measurements and analyses: individual students, classrooms, teachers, schools, school districts, states, nations?  4.

Murray Schafer started the World Soundscape Project (WSP). Originally conceived as an inquiry into the growing problem of noise pollution in Vancouver, the Project expanded to encompass the wider study of the relationship between sonic environments and human communities, both historical and present. From a small group of sound researchers making field recordings in natural landscapes and urban areas has grown the modern study of Acoustic Ecology on a global scale, and also the creative practice of Soundscape Composition, in which recorded elements of sound environments are expressively explored through electronic music. Beginning with a history of the WSP, this course surveys aspects of the field of Acoustic Ecology as an aesthetic, political, and ethical phenomenon, with special attention to its relationship with the creative and sound practices of Soundwalking, Deep Listening, and Soundscape Composition. This course will also contextualize the WSP within a broader history of music and sound in the background, including Saties Furniture Music, Muzak, and coffee shop music.  Throughout the course, students will participate in the activity and design of soundwalking, sonic field documentation / recording and sonic-environmental sampling, and the performance of background music. The course will culminate in a soundscape project entailing the composition of a Soundscape work, or the presentation of a creative mapping of aspects of their own sound environments; special guests will provide students with instruction in sound capture and manipulation.", "units": 9.0, "sections": [], "department": "Music", "name": "Contemporary Soundscapes"}, "76-892": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"times": [{"begin": "09:00AM", "room": "A22", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "10:20AM", "days": [2, 4], "building": "PH"}], "instructors": ["Wynn, James"], "name": "A"}], "desc": "In traditional public policy approaches, each step of the policy process from defining a problem to making a case for its solution is assessed in reference to rational models of economic and political actors.

To analyze optimal trading rules, we investigate the role of arbitrage in limit order markets, and then probe more deeply into auctions, which are essentially one sided limit order markets. We describe the main kinds of auctions, investigate optimal bidding behavior, and compare revenue outcomes from different auction formats. Individual valuations form the basis for bidding and trading, and in the third section of the course we investigate how those valuations are determined. We analyze how investment profiles are valued from their underlying dynamic choice profiles, we characterize attitudes towards risk, and we explain preferences for consumption at different points in time. Armed with estimates of risk tolerance and timing preferences for consumption over the life cycle, we derive optimal consumption smoothing, which determines investment and portfolio choices, and motivates the demand for mutual and pension funds, hedging practices, and more generally a financial retail sector.

It is critical that marketers understand the limitations of marcom tactics as well as how to best leverage and integrate marcom tactics for the strongest, most consistent and authentic brand voice in the targeted marketplace.  The entire IMC process is driven by the customer, and in the case of our discussions in this class, the consumer.   The course is designed to help students understand the integrated marketing communications model, the strategy and tools of the marketing mix and what makes an iconic brand.  The course is designed in five sections:  Part One focuses on understanding brands - iconic brands, terminology and types of branding.  Part Two focuses on the understanding of consumer behavior - one of the, if not the most critical part of understanding marketing.  Brands are built and defined in the minds of consumers.     Part Three focuses on IMC and the framework used by brand management to develop strategy, and understand audience segmentation and brand positioning to drive IMC.    Part Four focuses on understanding the IMC tactics available to marketers including advertising, social media and digital marketing, events and public relations.

Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalisms glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy.

However, the plethora of available methods poses a challenge for software practitioners: Which method should be adopted on a specific software project?  Software Engineering Methods addresses this challenge by introducing students to emerging approaches for developing software-intensive systems. Given the vast spectrum of software development endeavors, these approaches aim at defining custom hybrid methods by focusing on software development principles and practices together with their applicability to specific project contexts. Students learn to analyze the context of a software project and recommend a custom hybrid development method that satisfies the projects specific needs.  Students apply this knowledge in the context of a semester-long project. Their goal is to recommend the optimal software development method for a given project aimed at developing a specific software system. They model their recommended method and define a multi-level software engineering plan to enact the method. They build the first system increment by adopting their own method and following their own plan. They monitor their progress and reflect on the effectiveness of their approach and the need for continuous process improvement.

In 2011, Luis Suarez a Uruguayan soccer player was punished for allegedly calling French footballer Patrice Evra negro in England. But was the word negro, said in Spanish, racist?   Racism is a complex phenomenon that refers to historically hierarchical power differences between groups (e.g. Native populations and Europeans during the conquest), ideas about how humans can be classified into groups by race, and also discriminatory practices against non-dominant groups. This system of social relations and ideology serves to justify social inequality and differential treatment.  If we are to end racism, we must strive to understand it. What are the historical origins of racism? How is racism reproduced? How does race influence identity formation? Can racism produce positive identities? Why has the struggle against racism shifted from a demand for human rights to a search for diversity and inclusion?

Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security.  Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms.  Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty.  The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis.  Learning Objectives  Through lectures, discussions, readings, problem sets, written assignments, and presentations, students will develop knowledge and skills that will enable them to:   Apply the analytic tools and techniques of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics in the formulation and assessment of real-world policies.   Contribute to the development of defensible and transparent cost-benefit analyses.  Understand and identify the assumptions and limitations of cost-benefit analyses.  Critically assess cost-benefit analyses conducted by others.  Evaluate and compare alternative policies using the tools of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics.

This moment of TV history produced what I am calling long-form TV, in which narrative continuity was stretched over multiple seasons. TV in this form resembles 19th century novels that were first released serially in magazines and newspapers.  In both cases, audiences waited expectantly for new episodes, since they could not be binge-watched. The Wire was rooted in producer/writers David Simon and Ed Burns experiences in Baltimore, where the former had been a crime reporter and the latter a police detective. Simon has said that he made the series in order to tell truths about the city he could not tell in the newspapers.    This course will consider the wire in the context of realist fiction of the 19th century, twentieth-century crime fiction, earlier TV crime series, and other long-form TV, including Mad Men. We will try to explore The Wires realism, its continuing appeal, and its impact.  We will probably watch 3 seasons of The Wire.", "units": 9.0, "sections": [], "department": "English", "name": "The Wire: Crime, Realism, and Long-Form TV"}, "09-302": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"times": [{"begin": "10:30AM", "room": "2302", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "11:20AM", "days": [4], "building": "DH"}], "instructors": ["Stump, Karen"], "name": "A"}, {"times": [{"begin": "11:30AM", "room": "2302", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": "12:20PM", "days": [4], "building": "DH"}], "instructors": ["Stump, Karen"], "name": "B"}], "desc": "Students attend seminars presented by senior chemistry majors.

It moves from the silent cinema of the 1910s to the Weimar Republic, when German cinema represented Hollywoods greatest challenger in the international cinema world.  It then addresses the cinema of Hitlers so-called Third Reich, when German cinema dominated European movie theaters, and moves on to the cinema of divided Germany from 1949-1989, when cinema in the socialist east and cinema in the capitalist west developed in very different ways.  In the final weeks of the semester, we will address German cinema in the post-unification period, which has experienced a revival in popularity and interest.  The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood.  Among the great directors focused on in the course of the semester will be Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Fritz Lang, Leni Riefenstahl, Wolfgang Staudte, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.

The military-civilian dictatorships of the 1970s in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay were a period of State terrorism. This violent period resulted in thousands of disappeared people, political prisoners and exiles. These experiences have had a lasting impact in the new democracies. There is still a debate over how to address violations of human rights and how to make sense of the past, so that these events dont happen again. There has been a rich production of movies focusing on this historical period that serves as a document of how the struggles over how to come to terms with a traumatic past have been dealt with by different countries. These films also provide a glimpse of how popular culture serves as a vehicle to construct a social memory of recent history. Through films new generations that did not experience these traumatic events learns about what happened and what it means for particular social actors. We will analyze films from Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in order to better understand how these countries have dealt with a contested past.

We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

The course emphasizes causal analysis as the main research goal and multivariate linear regression as the main statistical tool.

More specifically, this course takes genre cinema to be a contact zone where a variety of narrative and formal orientations intersect, compete, and negotiate with one another: nationalism and transnationalism, convention and innovation, the traditional and the modern, official memory and counter history, realism and imagination, and so on.

According to critics, the use of such systems is often highly problematic because it is illegal to target individuals outside of formally declared war and because autonomous weapons systems can obfuscate historically accepted chains of military/police accountability and responsibility. Further, in the context of drone warfare, hidden costs are underreported in the mainstream media (including high civilian casualties, the intense psychosocial trauma inflicted upon communities that experience drone strikes, and the psychological impact on drone operators who witness the damage they cause through a computer monitor thousands of miles away).

What do these contemporary portraits tell us about the central if unusual role that intellectuals play in our culture? And how have significant transformations in key social institutions like higher education and the mass media shaped our conceptions of, and attitudes towards, intellectuals and intellectual life?  To explore these questions, well look at the history of intellectuals in literature and culture over roughly the last century, touching on a series of key moments and milieux from early portrayals of bohemia in novels like The Sun Also Rises (1926) to the autobiographical writings of controversial political figures like George Orwell and Ernesto Che Guevara, and popular genres like the campus novel and college films.

These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

Morphemes have the special property that they can be associated in a consistent way with meanings. In a progressive fashion, words are built from morphemes, phrases from words, and sentences from phrases. Sentences have different moods, and these moods correspond to their function with respect to the encoding and transmission of information. Indicative sentences carry information, interrogative sentences request information, imperative sentences demand action, conditional and modal sentences present alternative possibilities, and so on.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

The practical emphasis of the course reflects his extensive and varied background. The course focuses on the four stages necessary to any nonfiction story: idea, concept, reporting and writing. Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalism?s glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy.

Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.

One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches.

Both fair value accounting and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures are necessary ingredients for financial reports to convey financial institutions risk and performance in todays world of complex, structured, value and risk partitioning financial instruments and transactions. While financial institutions often report imperfect (or worse) fair value measurements and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures, careful joint analysis of the information they do provide invariably yields important clues about their risks and performance.

Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.  You can sign up for 15-513 for either 6 or 12 credits.  The reason there are two options is that you might be taking 15-513 in order to review the material and qualify to take other courses in your program. If this is the case, we expect that the work load for 15-513 will be more like a 6 unit class.  If, on the other hand, you are seeing the material for the first time, then it will be like a 12-unit course for you.

Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

The approach used to account for these increasing market dynamics is sustainability analysis, a method that formulates product strategies according to their expected profit half-life. We begin by looking at the different ways a corporation can be structured to give it an advantage. These include degrees of vertical integration, ranging from fully integrated (complete ownership of all the stages of value added), to virtually integrated (where the various stages of the company are linked electronically without ownership). We also look at advantages to be had through horizontal integration (core competencies), where components of value from different products are shared to yield sideways economies of scale. We then look at traditional big business strategy, where economies of scale dominate along with continuous, controlled innovation; a process referred to as scale orchestration. These standard cycle examples include Toyota, Federal Express, McDonalds, Toyota, Starbucks, and Las Vegas Casinos. We next look at Schumpeterian markets, where rapid wealth creation is followed by the gale of creative destruction, which yields advantage that must be renewed rapidly.

It will start with a somewhat linear approach towards cultural artifacts and remains, surveying them from the earliest periods down towards our own Common Era.

The methodologies will include investigating Time-Capsules which will focus on interrelated groupings of related cultural materials organized as - People, Places, Objects, Events and Ideas. The intention is to create a meaningful matrix which brings together the most significant examples of Art, Architecture, Design, Music and Drama. The setting of the Carnegie Museums will be used as a creative-context for interacting with potent symbolic examples of Human-creativity in ways that transcend what is normally experienced in printed words and pictures.
