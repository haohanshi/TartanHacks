While simple enough, the definition in fact suggests a concern with concentrated form and unified artistic effect. In a sense, the short story has been around as long as people have been telling each other tales, but as a literary form it came into its own in modern times, during the 19th century, and it continues to be produced in considerable numbers. For many readers one of the great features is the one Poe pointed to, it is short. People who have never finished a novel by Henry James must be legion. So, with the short story, we can experience something with genuine literary merit, in an accessible form. Concentration, of course, can bring issues of comprehension and often short stories can seem puzzling, or incomplete to the average reader. This class will attempt to develop our abilities to read with care and attention--and feeling--in order to make us better readers of any artistic text. The challenges of the short form turn out to be excellent opportunities for learning a lot, in a little space. We?ll make use of several inexpensive anthologies, and look at one or two central writers (Hemingway and Borges) in more depth. The class will require the writing of a few short papers, engaging in online discussions on Blackboard, and three in class tests.

One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.

Prerequisite: None  FALL 2015: Baba Yaga, Koschei the Immortal, the Firebird, Ivan the Tsarevich:  Russian fairy tales brim over with monsters and magic, witches and devils, heroes and villains, princes and queens. In this course we examine a wide selection of these tales for what they can reveal about Russian cultures ethics, aesthetics, values and habits of mind. Students discover these through four analytical approaches: structural, psychological, feminist and socio-political. Attention is paid to the ways in which fairy tales hold sway in literature and the fine arts from centuries past right through to the present day.

One such option is conducting   undergraduate research with a faculty member.  Students do not need to   officially register for undergraduate research unless they want it   listed on their official transcripts.  An ECE student who is involved in   a research project and is interested in registering this undergraduate   research for course credit on the official transcript may request to be   enrolled in this course.  To do this, the student should first complete   the on-line undergraduate research form available on the ECE   undergraduate student page.  Once the form has been submitted and   approved by the faculty member the student is conducting the research   with, the ECE Undergraduate Office will add the course to the students   schedule.

The examination comprises written and/or oral parts. The student will be considered to have passed the qualifying examination when he or she has successfully completed all of the required parts. A candidate must take the qualifying examination at the time specified by the department, generally within the first three semesters of study. Upon satisfactorily passing the examination, the student will be accepted as a candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

If, at the end of this six-year period, the Ph.D. has not been awarded, the student must reapply for admission to the graduate program and will be judged competitively with other students applying at the same time. If the student is re-admitted, he or she may, at the discretion of the department, be requested to pass the qualifying examination again before the Ph.D. is awarded.

They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well.  Given that they often operate in the commercial space the cost-performance of these systems needs to be such that the organizations dependent on such systems can turn a profit. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover the set of topics needed in order to design and build data intensive scalable systems.  In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance.   Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important.  These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns.  This course will introduce students to these concerns with the intent that they understand the extent to which things like deploying, monitoring, and upgrading impact the design. The course will be a hands-on project oriented course.  The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.  The students will gain exposure to the core concepts needed to design and build such systems as well as current technologies in this space.

This course will focus on the most important cultural developments and achievements of Europe in the 20th and 21st centuries. Based on an interdisciplinary approach to the multiple regions and countries located on a single continent, the course will equip students with the skills, methods, and concepts essential for a better understanding of European culture, society and thought.
